# TODO
* Basic gameplay loop (click card, click second card, do they match?)
* Dynamically allocate cards
* Different board sizes
* Timer
  * Possibly using the [halfdelay](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/init.html#HALFDELAY) function?
* Different difficulties
* Welcome menu with difficulty selection
* Ending win/lose screens with ability to reset
