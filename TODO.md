# TODO
* [x] Basic gameplay loop (click card, click second card, do they match?)
* [ ] Dynamically allocate cards
  * Use a linked list? It's super dumb but would probably make the prof happy
* [ ] Different board sizes
* [ ] Timer
  * Possibly using the [halfdelay](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/init.html#HALFDELAY) function?
* [ ] Different difficulties
* [ ] Welcome menu with difficulty selection
* [ ] Ending win/lose screens with ability to reset
